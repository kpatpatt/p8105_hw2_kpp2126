```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

*Read and clean the data; 
*retain line, station_name, station latitude / longitude, routes served (route1:route11), entry, vending, entrance_type, and ADA compliance (ada). 
*Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful).
```{r clean data}
getwd()
transit_df =
  read.csv("../../datascience/p8105_hw2_kpp2126/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

transit_df = 
  select(colnames())

```

*Write a short paragraph about this dataset â€“ explain briefly what variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. 
*Are these data tidy?
